                        winning more games has not equated to moving up the ranks, leaving Eliot with disappointing placements for two years in a row. 
                        With a cornhole masterclass at PKL this off-season, Eliot is truly ruffling some feathers - he's looking sharp and 
                        poised for a deep run in 2023.</p>

                        and running out west just months before BBG2023. A change in scenery should suit Eric, and it may be exactly
                         what he needs to overcome two middle-of-the-road showings in the last two tournaments. The time change will 
                         be no match for Eric, who will no doubt make a huge splash entering Long Beach. The key will be remembering 
                         his East Coast roots - if Eric can stay true to form, he should have no issues making waves and manifesting his destiny.</p>

                          off-season work ethic has been lackluster at best, and with proven weaknesses in previous years, he can definitely be bested.
                           Who will capitalize on their opportunity? Or will Joe remain unbeaten and keep a clean sheet through his third straight year?</p>

                        gameplan, will Panarello reclaim his Biggest Body title and more, or will the sleepless nights of fatherhood come back to haunt him?
                         He's got home-field advantage this year and could be primed to make some big body moves with support from his fans.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Eric/Panarello vs Eliot/Picca</p>
              <p class="card-text">Eric and Panarello are arguably two of the biggest bodies in the games this year but unfortunately for them Polish Horseshoes might not be the ideal pairing. Sharp shooter Johnson will look to take care of business early and Picca will secure his first W in the match up against his roommate.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Prediction: Eliot/Picca 21 â€“ Big Body Duo 14</p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Eric's Unlucky Pairings</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Eliot/Joe vs Tim/Eric</p>
              <p class="card-text">Eric is the sleeper of this yearâ€™s tournament. His success of winning it all will hinge on getting a couple of wins in these early matchups. Some might say the pairing process was rigged against him as Tim will most likely not pull his weight. Folks this one is not going to be close.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Nick/Theo vs Picca/Eliot</p>
              <p class="card-text">The last time these four met on the field tragedy almost struck. Eliotâ€™s words to Panarello that day may be the reason he is still alive. Theoâ€™s back finally starts to loosen up in this matchup and he will look to cement his mark on the tournament. The doctors will prescribe their way out of this one with a comfortable win. Johnson loses a bet to Panarello and tells him he loves him one last time.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Prediction: Dr. Nick/Dr. Theo 21 â€“ Picca/Eliot 15</p>

              <p class="card-text">Pan/Eric vs Tim/Joe</p>
              <p class="card-text">The odds were not in Panarello and Ericâ€™s favor in this one. Rumors are a side bet has already been made that Joe and Tim will not lose their serve. This game has the potential for the first forfeit of the BBG as a teammate collision is almost imminent.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Itâ€™s over before it started. With Picca napping and Tim more likely to hit his own cup than the opponents, Joe and Panarello just got to show up for this one.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Eric/Picca vs Joe/Theo</p>
              <p class="card-text">After 5 years of living together Picca and Eric have been through it all. The roommates will put the infighting aside and pull together the biggest upset of the games. A quick start flusters Theo and Joe and they do not have enough in the reserves to dig out of this one.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Tim/Theo vs Picca/Joe</p>
              <p class="card-text">I think itâ€™s fair to say at this point in the games Picca is mathematically out of contention from winning it all. His losing ways will rub off on Joe and the boys from Maine will capitalize early. There is a chance Joe will single handedly lead a comeback but Piccaâ€™s lack of groceries will leave him hungry.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Win prediction: Tim/Theo </p>

              <p class="card-text">Eric/Panarello vs Picca/Eliot</p>
              <p class="card-text">I canâ€™t see a better opportunity for the big body duo to win their first match up together. This may be the most even match up of the tournament. The peanut gallery will be watching this one on their feet. Eric hits his stride late in the game and Panarello harnesses his high school baseball pitching accuracy and they secure a much needed tourney win.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Theo/Joe vs the Nicks</p>
              <p class="card-text">Chances are Theo and Joe will be neck in neck in points at this point in the games. They both will have hit their groove and the Nicks will not stand a chance. Iâ€™m predicting a goose egg in this one and I think we can all guess what team that will be.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Prediction: Theo/Joe 21 â€“ The Nicks 0</p>

              <p class="card-text">One has to feel bad for Eliot in this game. Panarello continuously calls out to Jordy in attempts to make up for whatever he does the previous night. Joe excels per usual but Eliot and Panarello donâ€™t go away without a fight. This one is going into OT.  Picca ends the game as the hero and swishes it for three. He leaves the BBG on a high note with the hope for a better showing in 2022.</p>

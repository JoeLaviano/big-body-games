                      <p style="text-align:justify">It’s a tale as old as time - everybody lies, but the numbers don’t. Eliot is a perennial 
                        contender, year after year, and by all metrics could be at the top of the leaderboard – but by the power of ethereal 
                        life forms, it just doesn’t happen. Last year was disappointing; despite top 3 individual power rankings in both Kubb and 
                        Spikeball, US v Zantac found themselves at the bottom of the totem pole in 2024. However, all hope is not lost – Eliot has 
                        found himself a familiar face to team up with this year – the one and only Nick “Lenny” Panarello. Their chemistry is 
                        undeniable; the piggyback rides, the unconditional love, and the militaristic leadership roles the team has got to be 
                        terrifying for the other teams. They’re unproven in Team competition, but everyone knows Turn Around Lenny could be an 
                        absolute force to reckon with.Three years, three subpar results. Unlike Brock Purdy, Eliot has yet to find a way to thrive in 
                        the system.</p>

                        Eric his first championship trophy in 2024 and his first Biggest Body Award. Hiss off-hand Spikeball prowess 
                        and his chest-slap frisbee catches were welcome additions to the team that just kept on rolling; we’ll look to 
                        see if he’s gained any steps on his offensive skills this year. If Joe shows any signs of regression, it’ll be 
                        up to Eric to ensure the Too Spicy legacy lives on for another year.</p>

                        Joe is one win away from the infinity gauntlet of 5 straight years of BBG victory. How much longer do we need 
                        until we can claim this as the first BBG Dynasty? Needless to say, this is Joe’s world until someone else says 
                        otherwise. I’m sure he’s eagerly awaiting the day for a valiant competitor to step up to the plate and make a 
                        true challenge for the throne. Unfortunately for everybody else, the Too Spicy chemistry is at an all time 
                        high, and they show no signs of slowing down. The one glimmer of hope that anyone else has is Joe’s dismal 
                        6th place sabermetrics in Kubb, but aside from that – he looks untouchable. The door is wide open; who is brave 
                        enough to come knocking?</p>

                        Eliot. Can Turn Around Lenny make a name for themselves in a competition where the two other teams have built 
                        up an entire year of chemistry under the Team format? If Day 2 Panarello can become 2-Day Panarello, we may

                        1st year as a married man. Some say his bachelor life has held him back, and this could be the year he 
                        really comes into stride. All of his failed investments of the past lacked one thing – consistency. 
                        The international man of strategy has finally settled down and is ready to add some execution into his 
                        life. Statistically, Picca was a below-average athlete, placing 4th by individual sabermetrics and a 
                        devastating 6th place to end the weekend in Beer Die. The only item currently on his legacy is eating 
                        pizza rolls; can he put his negative DraftKings balance where his mouth is and show the other athletes 
                        that he deserves to be there with the best of the best?</p>

                        attendance this year. It’s a bittersweet year off for the crowd, as Boy Wonder brings a level of 
                        implied consent to the weekend that is unrivaled by the other athletes. Daddy wont be having a rough go at 
                        things this year, and we’ll all be overjoyed to see a new future BBG athlete enter the world.

                      <strong>Where's my Intern?</strong><br>
                      <p style="text-align:justify">Another familiar face with another familiar story – Tim Takach is the 
                        laboratory-built embodiment of the Big Body Games. On paper, he still looks like he’s got it all – the 
                        height, the girth, the talent; however, the sabermetrics reveal something intangible. Despite his physical 
                        gifts, he hasn’t had ‘that dog’ in him that everyone is hoping to see unlocked. Despite topping the 
                        statistics in Spikeball and Beer Die, we can call it nothing short of a full mental collapse in the other 
                        3 games that left Boost Looters out of contention for 2024. But wait – there’s more; this is Timmy’s last 
                        game before entering the lifelong embrace of fatherhood. Could that be the linchpin that gives Tim the edge 
                        we’ve all been waiting to see? Could Baby Takach be the final inspiration that unlocks him into proving that 
                        he is the best of the best? A BBG championship could just be icing on the cake for what is shaping up to be a 
                        great year for the Takach family, but only one athlete can decide if the time is now for victory.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">Timmy Takes is back, but not by popular demand. The peanut gallery let Timmy have it in 2023 not just in his takes but also in his 2023 Big Body Game performance. Retirement was a consideration, but it was ultimately decided to bring back the takes for at least 1 more year. Timmy takes received heavy criticism for its critique of the opposing players last year. The world is asking for a new type of takes, one that butters up the competitors with high praise and compliments and focuses solely on their best qualities. Rest assured you will not find that here. We stick to what we know, and the facts do not lie.  So sit back, relax and grab a drink and let the Timmy Takes take you on a journey for this year’s 2024 games.  </p>
              <p class="card-text">Before getting into this year’s Big Body Games details we have sad news to bring to the readers. Dr. Nicholas Panarello will not be in attendance this year. He will be competing in a “Whiz Bowl” (we are still searching for answers regarding the details of this event) and he had to withdraw his name from consideration. Eliot Johnson will be impacted the most by this decision and the viewers will need to wait to see the dynamic duo that we call Turn Around Lenny until 2025.  </p>
              <p class="card-text">With the absence of Panarello, comes a change in the framework for this year's games. Teams have been carefully chosen based upon, friendship, performance, and most importantly biased opinions. Each game will count as a single point and the most wins at the end of the games will lead to the crowned victors.  For the analysis below we took a deep dive in the team’s performance from the previous year. A big factor of the results last year came from what we have now coined as the “Panarello Effect.” Due to a drastic change in performance we saw in Nick Panarello in 2023 from Day 1 to Day 2 – we noted which day the event took place if a team played against Panarello and we added in a stat correction where applicable to get to the teams true record.   </p>
              <p class="card-text">We also need to take a brief moment here to celebrate the bachelor Nick Picca. We hope he is able to escape from his new corporate life and make it to the games on time. Let’s just hope he can keep his eye on the prize and that he is ready for a fierce battle of competition that awaits him.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Let's meet the teams!</p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle">Analysis of the 2023 Results</h6>
                  <p class="card-text">Eric and Joe had a 5-2 record last year, posting the best performance compared to the two other teams. Did the results really justify a 5-2 record?  Let’s take a closer look: 2 of their 5 wins came from Day 1 Panarello. Should we really count those? I’ll leave that up to the readers, but we all know where we stand with this. They also experienced a devastating loss to the Boost Looters in Polish Horseshoes and are effectively defeated when playing against the opposing teams they will match up against this year. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">Timmy Take’s corrected record for Too Spicy in 2023: 4-2 (2 wins removed due to Day 1 Panarello, and an extra win added for beating Day 2 Panarello) </p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle">Timmy's Take on their chances</h6>
                <p class="card-text">The presumed favorite heading into the 4th annual BBG. Joe looks to capture his 4th straight BBG crown, while Eric eagerly seeks his first. It was a tough showing for Eric in 2023. He just could not find his rhythm and his partners did not do him any favors. Joe’s consistency should help stabilize the team and allow Eric to blossom into the athlete that we know he can be. Their West Coast bond should translate to instant success on the field. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Keys to Success</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Let Eric do the grocery shopping – if food becomes scarce a 3rd place result may be in the books. </p>
                <p class="card-text">Keep space during spikeball – this team features the biggest and smallest body during the games. Joe will need to be mindful of the surroundings and avoid any unforeseen contact with his teammate</p>
                <p class="card-text">Show no mercy to the Boost Looters – Joe brings stability to any team that he is on and they do not need to get frustrated with a loss here and there. It will be imperative to keep the other teams grounded and this especially goes for the Boost Looters</p>
                <p class="card-text">Do not have the worst record in Cornhole – If I have to pick a last place finish for this team it has to be this event. A 3rd place finish could cause their title hopes and dreams to come crashing to a halt  </p>
                <p class="card-text">Eric conquers the King Kubb – Known for his ability to knock down the field Kubbs, the opposite can be said about knocking down the King Kubb. If Eric can move past this we see a lot of wins in their future.  </p>

            <h6 class="card-subtitle">Analysis of the 2023 Results</h6>
                <p class="card-text">US vs. Zantac wrapped up 2023 with an even record. After a closer look at their games, there is need for some adjustments. There are no cheers to be had for beating Tim twice at Kubb and they suffered two defeats to Day 2 Panarello. Maybe their outlook won’t be as grim as the audience thinks for 2024 but their results scream inconsistency and they will need to run the table in Kubb.  </p>
                <p class="card-text">Timmy Takes’s corrected record for US. Vs Zantac 3-2 (two losses removed from Day 2 Panarello and 1 win removed from Day 1 Panarello).  </p>

            <h6 class="card-subtitle">Timmy's Take on their chances</h6>
              <p class="card-text">The 2023 results does not paint a favorable picture for Eliot and Theo. We have heard reports that Eliot made a train trip to Dr. Bowe’s clinic for Lasik surgery this past week which could put a change in their success for 2024 but the odds are stacked against them. A blind squirrels does find an acorn occasionally but in this year’s games there just will not be enough acorns to be had. </p>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Keys to Success</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Eliot, please miss the death cup - in order to come out on top in this year’s games they will need to battle through each one. It’s imperative they do not give away games. It’s sad we have to write this in there but the odds are this has a higher chance of occurring again then them coming out in 1st in this event.  </p>
              <p class="card-text">Have the best record in Kubb – This will be a battle between them and Too Spicy. If they can earn the most wins in this event, the landscape may start to change in their favor</p>
              <p class="card-text">Theo keeps it simple during Spikeball – Do not try to recreate the glory days of high school basketball. Keep the serve on top of the net, we aren’t fishing for lobsters in Vermont.</p>

            <h6 class="card-subtitle">Analysis of the 2023 Results</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Like US. Vs. Zantac, Boost looters finished an even .500 in 2023. However if you think the scheduled was rigged in 2023 you do not need to look any further then the Boost Looter’s schedule. Panarello effect, crippled the boost looters in Day 2 and they can rest easy that they will not need to deal with match up inconsistencies in this year’s games.  </p>
                <p class="card-text">Timmy Takes’s corrected record for Boost Looters 4-2  (two losses removed from Day 2 Panarello and 1 win removed from Day 1 Panarello).  </p>

            <h6 class="card-subtitle">Timmy's Take on their chances</h6>
              <p class="card-text">How can you not want to root for these guys? Their performance is entirely based on momentum and they have been known to take down some of the favorites. However consistency is an issue and Kubb will be a problem. With every big win, comes an even bigger loss and they have yet to find a way to overcome these blunders. We do not see them winning this year’s games but if they can ride a few victories at the start against Too Spicy, you never know what may happen.  </p>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Keys to Success</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Find more boost – Once momentum is found they have to retain it. Whether that’s in tequila shots for Picca or Truly bets for Tim. They need to find their secret sauce in order to stay relevant </p>
              <p class="card-text">Tim wins a game in Kubb – He went winless in Kubb in 2023 and has not had a good track record in the previous 3 BBGs. One way to find momentum is to secure a victory in this event. However will it be enough to spring them to the title? </p>
              <p class="card-text">#1 record in Polish horseshoes – News from Washington state brought highlights of Nick Picca and his revamped frisbee throw. Let’s hope this translates onto the field. </p>
              <p class="card-text">Limit the chipotle – This team does not have a great track record with E. Coli. Let’s hope chipotle does not cause the demise of this team</p>

              <p class="card-text">Two way tie: Too spicy and Boost Looters. Boost looters take an early advantage but run out of steam in the final couple of games allowing Too Spicy to catch up. </p>

              <p class="card-text">US vs. Zantac: Eliot and Theo run away with this one. But only due to sheer necessity of staying relevant in the games. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Boost Looters: SPLASH, SPLASH, SPLASH – truly chugs are in the opposing team’s futures and there is no stopping the momentum in this one. We pray for their opponents that they do not play this one first thing in the morning. </p>              
              <h6 class="card-subtitle">Cornhole</h6>
              <p class="card-text">True toss up! Slippery boards led to drawn out games last year. An anonymous source claims that US. Vs. Zantac will come out on top but we will need to wait and see how the results pave out for this one. </p>

              <p class="card-text">The results will be close but there are not enough games to catch up with Too Spicy. Tim’s arm handicaps the Boost Looters too much despite a solid showing from Picca.  US vs. Zantac have their moments but there are just too few of them to lead to any real success. The boys will look to take the crown away from Joe in 2025. </p>

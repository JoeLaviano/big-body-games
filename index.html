                      <p style="text-align:justify">Three years, three subpar results. Unlike Brock Purdy, Eliot has yet to find a way to thrive in the system.
                        As expected based on last year's scouting report, Eliot managed a podium finish in Cornhole but dealt out bottom 3 placements in the remaining
                        events, ending with his 5th place overall finish in Maryland. A new scoring scheme may be exactly what Eliot needs to break out of year's of inequity against
                        him. It is yet to be seen whether 2024 will be the first team competition in BBG history, but odds aren't in his favor to unlock the full force of 
                        Turn Around Lenny in this year's tournament. If there's any positive outlook from 2023, he did improve on his 2021 placement, but he's going to have 
                        to dig deep, play the odds, and build some chemistry if he wants to find any trend toward success this year.</p>

                      <p style="text-align:justify">Let's be real for a second - 2023 was a tough go for Mr. Holtzman. He played his heart out, 
                        was the Biggest Body in almost every intangible metric, yet somehow came in dead last AND got robbed of a title he earned outright.
                        If there's ever been a conensus in this group, it's that everyone hated Eric in 2023. He's had another year in the Santa Ana sun 
                        (with plenty of sunscreen to boot), and the past is in the past for Eric. If there's one thing we know, is that 2023 will be the last year 
                        Eric goes down quietly. Look for blood, sweat, and tears on the floor this year - none of which will be Eric's, as his revenge tour comes in at 
                        full force. Keep in mind that another last place finish for Eric may not just be the last BBG for him, but for everyone.</p>

                        to what little doubters he had left that Joe is the real deal, and has to be considered the crowd favorite until further notice. Perhaps the only negative
                        we can say about the three-time Champ is that this will be his toughest year as commissioner, as the short schedule will lead to tight deadlines on the
                        planning front - will he have enough time to train and stay sharp? Or will this finally be the year that someone steps up to the challenge? As they

                      <p style="text-align:justify">It was obvious from the get-go that missing 2022 was a bad choice for Panarello, as day 1 of 2023 could not
                        have possibly gone any worse. Struggling at every event, Nick was in a rough spot, with such a small probability of a comeback that the 
                        rest of the athletes counted him out. But Day 2 Panarello was a sight for sore eyes - by far the best Saturday performance that BBG has ever seen, 
                        Dr. Panarello outscored all athletes, possibly even carrying Joe in multiple events to secure his championship. That's the Panarello we'd never expect,
                        and is exactly the Panarello we'd need to see should he want to improve on his results this year. However, logistics are currently his main downfall, as a 
                        tough pairing of medical rotations and a mid-Atlantic wedding are both going against his chances on making his way to the tournament. The potential
                        appearance of Jordy is the single-most defining aspect of the 2024 BBG, as it could also mean the first year the competition takes a team format. The state of the 
                        tournament is quite literally in Dr. Panarello's hands - will his surgical precision resurface, or will real-life responsibility win out?....Only time will tell.</p>

                        last months on this Earth (as an unmarried man). Mr. Picca has been steadily improving year after year, and there seems to be a strategy he's 
                        been able to execute - win early and try to survive the rest. We hope wedding planning hasn't bogged him down too much; he'll need a clear head and 
                        a solid plan if he wants to break into his first ever podium finish. Just months away from a set of vows he can't refuse, he'll be equipped with all 
                        the confidence in the world to leapfrog his way to the top. However, the other athletes aren't going to let him off easy, as he'll likely be
                        heavily targeted during non-BBG exhibition play. Congratulations buddy - just be prepared to call an ambulance (for you).</p>

                      <p style="text-align:justify">Don't let the results fool you - 2023 was a disappointing year for the Timmy Shimmy. While he did
                        secure his third podium finish in a row, the separation between Tim and the other finishers widened by a huge margin. He was only 1 point
                        from second place in 2021, dropping to a whopping 11 points behind second place in 2023. His regression to the mean should come as a shock,
                        as the most physically gifted athlete in the pool needs to find a way to breakout of his slump. Third place in spikeball and going 0-8 in Kubb 
                        look to be decent places to make up some ground, but there's not enough Truly chugs in the world that could tell us there's a mental aspect that needs to
                        be thoroughly evaluated. Where is the Timmy of yesteryear - bucket hat style, shimmy swag, and lack of body control that everyone's been
                        counting on? He'll need to brew up something special if he wants to dethrone to two clear favorites above him for yet another year.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The boys are back and the Timmy Takes are live. We apologize for the delays and that you had to suffer through the abysmal scouting reporting that was released earlier this year. There was a lot of data to sift through and life updates to report on. We could not risk being hasty in sending out the takes. Start packing your bags and let the games begin! </p>
              <p class="card-text">After a smaller field in the 2022 games, the full field of 7 have committed entry to the 2023 games. Two time champion Joe Laviano enters the games as an early favorite for a three peat. The doctors, Nick and Theo return from a year off but little is known yet how fatherhood has affected their ability to play. Eliot and Timmy will no longer be fighting wedding planning fatigue and will look to stay cool in the Mid-Atlantic summer heat. Eric returns East and will look to keep the trophy out on the West Coast. And last but certainly not least we have Mr. Picca. Recently engaged, he will look to maintain his focus as his mind floats to wedding preparations and fear of another girth off. </p>
              <p class="card-text">Not only do we have a full field but we also have another exciting update for the year, MORE GAMES. The athletes will be tested with a jammed pack scheduled that will put their will and determination to test. This year Timmy Takes will take a turn from previous years as we will dive into 2 categories to determine this year’s standing fate. The data is ironclad and we expect the results to come in close. </p>

              <p class="card-text">By far the most impactful measurement of the Big Body games. He uses a combination of factors to rank the athletes such as location, new developments, athletic prowess and most importantly if they have the Big Body X Factor. </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#7 - Picca</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Until he shows us he is capable of finishing other than last, we have the spot securely cemented there for him. Even with a first place finish in the first event of the 2021 games, Picca still managed to get last. We are deeply worried about his game and we fear he will be easily rattled by wedding questions. Picca’s best chance of winning this year will be the pizza roll off with Joe. If he loses that, expect it to reflect early in the games. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Starts with a win in the Pizza roll off. He thrives off of momentum, calf slaps, and early bedtimes. If he can manage to get all 3, maybe he will surprise us. </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#6 - Panarello</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The only trophy Panarello will be vying for this year is the Biggest Body. There’s too much unknowns going into this year for him especially after a lack luster performance in the 2021 games. If he is able to turn his fortune in Polish Horseshoes, we could see a Top 3 finish but the odds of him catching a frisbee are stacked against him. Rest up Doc, your talents may be needed more in a post-spikeball bone fracture. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Catch a frisbee. Panarello went winless in Polish horseshoes and it destined him for a bottom half finish. If he can stomp his way into the top half in that event, maybe he will be able to bring Owen home a new souvenir.  </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#5 - Eliot</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I struggled with this one but in the end this just felt right. Eliot will win his fair share of games but like the previous two BBGs it won’t matter. The long train commute and the heat will melt his aspirations away. I am most concerned that he may miss his train stop due to trying to save Zelda from the depths. Eliot has the skills to perform well but we don’t like his chances in the Maryland summer heat. Try again next year Johnson. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Win more. Eliot will leave the games above .500 in win percentage but he needs to perform well in SpikeBall and Beer die in order to have a shot at this. </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#4 - Theo</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Some may say this is a harsh take after a second place finish in the 2021 games but like Panarello there are just too many unknowns to give us confidence in this year games. Rumors have spread of his inability to sink a free throw and the back and forth summer travel between Philly and Maine cannot be healthy for the back. He may well be chief resident, but he certainly won’t be leading the BBG. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">Consistency. We don’t expect a last place finish from Theo in any of the events and with the second easiest schedule there’s a chance he can make a run at this. </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#3 - Eric</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I put a lot of faith in my takes last year with Eric and in return I received a last place finish. However there’s just something about that LA spotlight that makes people shine. As the Kubb fan favorite and my favorite for Biggest Body, there’s just a lot to like with his chances this year. If he can get through with a middle place finish in polish horseshoes the title may be in reach. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">If Eric can knock down the king kubb and secure a middle place finish in polish horseshoes he will be right in the mix. However those are Big Ifs and the king kubb has his number. </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#2 - Joe</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Being the two time defending champ we would expect Joe to be ranked first here. Questions are swirling why he needed to set up a practice game in Tacoma the weekend before. It just gets you wondering, has he lost his touch? We sense a change of forecast for this year and expect a plane full of fear will be arriving in BWI Thursday morning. Stay hungry Laviano, your games begin early with a Pizza Roll Off. </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still lose?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">If Joe loses big on the bet board, expect that to trickle down to his game play. We will all be rooting for Picca in the Pizza Roll off.  </p>
              <h5 class="card-subtitle">#1 - Timmy</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Call it bias, I encourage it. Bucket Hat Tim returns with a new hat, no car and less weight. He’s been heat rash free for over year and now has fully acclimated to the weather. My only concern is the truly chugs, stop betting and just get to playing.   </p>
              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How could they still win?</h6>
              <p class="card-text">The talent is there and home court advantage has its perks. Kubb has been his nemesis in the past 2 games so a 3rd place finish or better there may secure him the trophy. </p>
